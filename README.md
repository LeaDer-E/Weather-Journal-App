## Appendix

* I made changes to the HTML and CSS file

## Optimizations

The country options have been added, but unfortunately I think that there is a problem with the site [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) there are no countries that work except the United States, so the line:
```
 region = "us"; // i make it country code "us" only because i didn't fount any other working country
```

was added to be the only choice in the API is the states.
